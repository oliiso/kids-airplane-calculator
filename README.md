# kids-airplane-calculator
A calculator game for those who want to work on their addition, subtraction, and multiplication skills.

This was a group project done for an early programming class with Andy Anaya, Sophia Kist, and Asher Porter.
I would like to implement a timer, and the highscore, but for now it works as a simple test of your basic math skills.
